# AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Assistant

## Overview
This project is an AI-based travel planning system that creates a complete and organised itinerary for the user. Instead of simply listing activities, the system reads the travel details, checks for mistakes like overlapping timings or unrealistic schedules, and then fixes them automatically. The goal is to build something that feels like a small travel-planning team working together to create a clean and conflict-free itinerary.

The project uses LangChain, structured outputs, and a step-by-step workflow to manage how the travel plan is processed. Each part of the notebook adds a new piece of logic, starting from setting up the environment, defining the data structures, generating the itinerary, resolving conflicts, and finally presenting a proper breakdown
